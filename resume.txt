AI is the most important development in human history.
Let's make it an overwhelmingly positive one.

Summary
 I am a mathematically- and scientifically-inclined software engineer, an expert
 in distributed systems, and a people-person. I apply bleeding-edge research to
 practical objectives in artificial intelligence, data-intensive software
 architectures, and human systems... with PLUCK AND VERVE!
